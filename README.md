# cloud-foundations

## at a glance

First and foremost, this is intended to be a learning project for me.
I want to level up with my cloud technologies, and build a bit of a scaffold for future projects.

### goals & principles

- go all-in on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- document & version control everything
- do *everything* in a repeatable way.
  - everything *as code*
  - minimize *point and click* configuration (code > CLI > point+click)
- over-engineer (enterprise production-ready even if that's not where its going), but also try to ship something (practice good engineering practice)
- prioritize monitoring & testing

### tech stack

- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- Terraform
- Kubernetes (k8s)
